With this APP you can easily find useful recipes with microgreens.

What are this microgreens? [Microgreens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgreen) are vegetable greens (not to be confused with sprouts or shoots) harvested just after the cotyledon leaves have developed (and possibly with one set of true leaves). They are grown or purchased by people focused on nutrition, or else are used as both a visual and flavor component, primarily in fine dining restaurants. Chefs use colorful microgreens to enhance the attractiveness and taste of their dishes with distinct delicate textures and unique flavors, such as sweet and spicy. Microgreens are smaller than ‚Äúbaby greens‚Äù (e.g. spinach, kale, arugula, radicchio), but harvested later than sprouts (e.g. broccoli, mung bean, soya bean, wheat, and sunflower). Among upscale grocers, they are now considered a specialty genre of greens, good for garnishing salads, soups, sandwiches, and plates.


## Available Scripts

Create and Deploy a React App in Two Minutes
You can get started building React apps for free on Heroku.

        npm install -g create-react-app
        create-react-app my-app
        cd my-app
        git init
        heroku create -b https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
        git add .
        git commit -m "react-create-app on Heroku"
        git push heroku master
        heroku open


To create react project run next:

### `npx create-react-app name-of-your-project`

To install latest version of Bootstrap please run command:

### `npm i -save bootstrap@latest`

After installed Bootstrap add next to index.js

### `import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`



## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
